# HL_FloPyCourse
Code based on FloPy course

This repo contains two folders. 

One is the `Exe` folder that contains the modflow executables and another folder named `Applied`. 

The last folder contains a:
- python-file (`itobes.py`), 
- two excel files uses as input defintions for the soil-schematization (`soil_schematization.xlsx`) and the definitions of the located wells (`wells_definitions.xlsx`). 
- a notebook (`2020-02-01 use case definition.ipynb`) where the Modflow model is build and tried to be run

In the notebook it can be seen that the program terminates succesfully, while the output head-file only contains zeros..
