# HL_FloPyCourse
Code based on FloPy course

This repo contains two folders. One is the `Exe` folder that contains the modflow executables.
And another folder `Applied` containing a python-file (`itobes.py`), two excel files uses as input defintions for 
the soil-schematization (`soil_schematization.xlsx`) and the definitions of the located wells (`wells_definitions.xlsx`). In the notebook `2020-02-01 use case definition.ipynb` the Modflow model is build and tried to be run, but where the program terminates succesfully the output head file is only containing zeros.
